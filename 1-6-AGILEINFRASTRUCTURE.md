## Agile Infrastructure:


Our organizations large and small including probably
yours are relying on hybrid cloud infrastructures,
combining public and private cloud with dedicated
servers. Therefore, you collect the rewards of
colocation security in combination with the flexibility
and scalability of public cloud.
Here’s some of major drivers why an agile infrastructure
is beneficial for DevOps:
• You pay for what you use with transparent and
simple pricing.
• You can quickly provision and de-provision your
test and production environments from your code
base (IaC - Infrastructure as Code).
• You have architectural flexibility.
• You can easily expand other geographies.
• You probably have better security
• You stay compliant without audits and additional
costs.
