## 3.4 - Você cria com qualidade e monitoramento

You build fast, reliable and amplified feedback loops
in all stages of your software delivery and operations
lifecycle. Because quality is not a monopoly which
belongs to a certain team, everyone strives for builtin
quality. In order to make sure you have correctly
done your job, you don’t wait for feedback from
another team. Or you don’t ask somebody else’s
permission to deploy your code in production. You
trust your team with peer reviews of your design,
code, test and infrastructure. 

You always build test automation and monitoring
(telemetry) for every possibly measurable and
testable feature. You are conscious that if a feature
deserves your time to be coded and delivered, it also
deserves continuous, reliable, fast and consistent
testing with test automation. Moreover, it also
deserves continuous monitoring and built-in
analytics in your software to validate what you win
from this feature matches why you built it in the first 
place. In all environments including production and
non-production. 

Every check-in in your code repository automatically
adapts, restructures or if necessary rebuilds your
operational environments, automatically rebuilds
impacted applications and ultimately executes all
automated tests to validate existing features and the
purpose of your latest check-in. Once validation is
successful, the same changes are automatically
adapted to your production.


Your built-in analytics and telemetry in your
applications continuously monitor and record key
events in your software and in its operational
environments. The key metrics (such as number of
orders, number of log-ins, CPU usage, RAM usage,
CPU load, number of errors, length of database
queries and many others) are continuously recorded
and presented in real-time, so it is a matter of
minutes, if not seconds before your team discovers a
negative impact triggered by a deployment. This is
why fast feedback loops are vital to get your job
done fast.
