## Você constrói sistemas para alcançar metas de negócio


You and your teams are fully aware that you are
getting paid to serve your clients and to accomplish
the mission of your organization. Therefore, you are
respectful to everyone’s time and resources from
your organization and clients. Before you commit
any long-term project, you test drive and validate
proposed and envisioned business value you expect
from your IT solution. You show your clients the
models, prototypes, various A/B variations or
lightweight versions of what you intend to build.
Then you measure and record their reactions and
feedback to understand how you fine-tune your
product and service, and if your clients like it at all. 

You don’t add features to your product just because
you have a good feeling about them. You test your
ideas and build tangible, demonstrable and
reproducible evidence that what you are building 
and investing the resources from your organization
will most probably add the bottomline and positively
differentiate your employer from its competitors.
