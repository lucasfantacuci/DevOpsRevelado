## 3.6 - Seus times escalam ainda melhor enquanto seu negócio cresce


Now imagine an average organization which evolves
from 1 to 1,000 developers. As the organization was
small, developers were continuously building and
deploying their code to production. However, as the
organization gets bigger, there is now a much larger
organizational and bureaucratic hierarchy, more fear
from mistakes. There is now more coordination and
communication effort required to deploy your code
in production. Therefore, average number of code
deployments per day per developer usually reduces
and at best remains same while organizations grow. 

However, DevOps high performers play in a different
league and they manage to increase average number
of code deployments per day per developer as they
have more developers. With correct software
architecture, correct teams, correct mission, correct
leadership and correct culture, DevOps high
performers such as Google, Amazon, Facebook,
Netflix and Apple have already proven that this is
possible. Your organization can be the next one to
become one of these DevOps High Performers.
