CONCLUSION
In this section we explained you what DevOps is and
what it isn’t. For you we have also covered the major
movements and principles which DevOps was
derived from.
A small caveat: Like many agile practitioners have
been unfortunately doing in their agile practices
since years, you shouldn’t stick to any stone-grained
definition of DevOps to dictate how your particular
organization, your product, your service and most
importantly your team should use DevOps. There is
no one-size-fits-all solution. Neither in agile nor in
DevOps.
Never forget that it is all about learning, experimentation
and adaptation. As DevOps will do a lot of good
work for us, it is our role biggest duty as human
minds to identify our correct version and tone of
DevOps. This is what each and every successful
DevOps organization including Google, Amazon,
Facebook, Netflix and Apple have been doing
