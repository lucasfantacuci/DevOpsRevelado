As your IT organization constantly breaks promises
and frustrates its stakeholders, your stakeholders
become more demanding to compensate the past.
You and your leaders have often say nothing, but
“why not” unless there is a better job offer lined up.
Then your software development and delivery
organizations are assigned a larger challenge than
usual. As your critical systems and IT architecture are
not even in a close proximity to cover these 
requirements in given “urgent” timelines, you set out
designing your new workarounds on the top of your
existing set of workarounds.
