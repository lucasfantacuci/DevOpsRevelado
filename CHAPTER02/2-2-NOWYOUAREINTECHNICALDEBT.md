Continuous firefighting, workarounds and unplanned
activities to save your day will only result in
accumulation of more technical debt. This not only
impacts the performance of your development and
operations, but it also negatively impacts all other
units including your architecture, information
security, testing, product management, release
management and your business stakeholders.
You can resemble technical debt in financial debt.
The more financial debt you have, the less options
you have got to reach your desired goals. Ultimately
it becomes almost impossible to give correct decision
to reach the desired outcomes and you would be
more likely to make additional financial debt.
Technical debt has no difference. The more technical
debt you have, the less options you have to build and
deliver correct solutions. Finally, you end up building
workarounds on the top of workarounds, house of
cards on house of cards. And it is a matter of time
before they all collapse. You already know this.
