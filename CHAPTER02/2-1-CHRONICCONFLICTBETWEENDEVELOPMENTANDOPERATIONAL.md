Among many other key responsibilities, there are
two major missions in your IT organization:
1. Your development team has to quickly deliver to
respond changing demands from your clients and
from the market your business serves for.
2. Your operations team has to guarantee stable,
predictable, secure and continuous service to
serve your clients and market.
Given that your IT organization is structured in this
way, your development and operations teams have
conflicting missions and motivations. This conflict
reduces productivity, quality of service, client 
satisfaction and outcomes of your IT department and
finally your overall business performance.
