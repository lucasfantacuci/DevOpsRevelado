In this chapter we explained the challenges most of
businesses and IT professionals face. The downward
spirals and vicious cycles almost every business and
every professional live with.
Gartner estimates that companies worldwide waste
yearly about 600 billion USD for non-budgeted and
non-scheduled IT maintenance work to keep
revenue-generating IT systems up and running. Just
to express this number with digits to see how it looks
like: $600,000,000,000.-
As it might have been clear for you until this point,
this level of waste in a highly cognitive profession
such as information technology is not trivial to
comprehend.
This is a good challenge to tackle with. DevOps have
some answers for some companies and may be for
your company too. Of course, if your company is
ready to experiment, learn and adapt.
