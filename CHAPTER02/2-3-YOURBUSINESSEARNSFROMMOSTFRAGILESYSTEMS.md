A non-surprising but concerning fact about your
business is that your most critical and revenuegenerating
systems are most prone to errors,
crashes and downtimes.
These systems are usually in the center of your
business and you have yet to participate a meeting
that they are not somehow part of discussions. They
are the most critical systems impacted by almost all
projects. Due to the their severity in your business,
they deserve continuous work, urgent changes,
unplanned fixes, and yet these systems are never
tired of producing Priority-1 incidents.
