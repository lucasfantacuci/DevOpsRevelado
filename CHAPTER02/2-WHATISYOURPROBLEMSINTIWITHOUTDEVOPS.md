## 2 - Quais são os seus problemas em TI sem DevOps?


Em seu mundo de TI sem DevOps, times de desevolvimento e operacional normalmente conflitam. Garantia de qualidade de ponta a ponta das funcionalidades requeridas pelo cliente se iniciam após a equipe de desenvolvimento começar a trabalhar em um outro projeto totalmente diferente. 


Information
security and production readiness audits are
conducted the day before the planned production
roll-out. Solving software problems at this critical
project stage, especially design and security flaws
that must have been already identified and rectified
8 months ago do not only yield challenges for the
successful continuity of your IT, but also for the
continuity of your business. Tired developers,
uncooperative operations, testing and information
security silos, demanding but desperate project and
product managers, angry executives and frustrated
clients and IT stakeholders do not really add much
added value.

Too many hands-off of activities and dependencies in
every possible imaginable direction, countless
uncoordinated, manual, nontransparent work in your
IT department is just another day in business.

Despite of long lead times to get any work done,
there is no better option available, at least not for
now, and you know that you still need this job to
earn money.
Finally the big day comes. After a problematic and
chaotic production deployment which caused
significant downtime at your business, you wonder if
your deployment broke anything in the existing
production functionality. You start thinking of the
lack of clarity and tangible evidence about what
really have happened and what have been really
impacted in your production systems.
And yet Go-Live celebration already starts in the
corridors of your large IT room. It’s also time for you
to have a drink and mentally recover from the tough
and sleepless night you left behind. What you broke
last night in your production will be anyway the
problem of somebody else. This is not a big deal… 


Having said that you must be now wondering how it’s
possible at all that these tough projects can finish in
one or another way although they once have been
really in an ugly and desperate shape. The answer
lies in The Infinite Monkey Theorem. In a nutshell,
the infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey 
hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for
an infinite amount of time will surely type a given
text, such as the complete works of William
Shakespeare. This is no joke.
Similar to this, beyond any predictability about when
the work can finish, provided that your IT team
sufficiently delays and gains time for a given project,
it will surely deliver the project.
