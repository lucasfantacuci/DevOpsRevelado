And finally everyone gets little bit busier. Your
calendar have no more free space to perform an
hour of uninterrupted work for the position you are
hired and paid for. Emails rain to your inbox, so you
are now using mostly unproductive time at your
meetings to clear and scan your mostly unclear and
pointless incoming emails. You are curious why there
is no mandatory training at your organization to
teach how to use and write emails.
You’re usually dependent on other teams to be able
to continue your own work. And yet the expectations
you communicated a couple of weeks ago are not
even in the radar of the other team yet because they
just started their new “Horizon 2400” project while
they had to solve 9 Priority-1 incidents caused by
their fragile software applications.
You are slowly little bit impatient because you need
some answers from your designated single point of 
contact person at the other team to get your own
work going.
You couldn’t stop and sent another email to remind
your request. This time you put her boss in CC and
you thought you should have done this when you
sent your request for the first time.
A couple of seconds haven’t passed yet and two outof-office
notifications popped up on your screen.
Your single point of contact at the other team will be
at “Horizon 2400” workshops until the end of this
week. And her boss is sick at home today.
