You Avoid Big Bang and Start Small


As you already know you canâ€™t really shake the status
quo in one go and announce an organizational
DevOps transformation on day one. You should first

conscious about the necessity of improvements and
who are the most receptive to consider a different
way of working. And teams which are unconditionally
willing to serve their organization and clients.
