## Manifesto Ágil


Agile Manifesto:
With DevOps you adhere to the cornerstones
defined by the agile manifesto:
• You respect individuals and interactions over
processes and tools.
• You respect working software over comprehensive
documentation.
• You respect customer collaboration over contract
terms and negotiation.
• You respect responding to change over following
a plan.
